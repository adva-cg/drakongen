Procedure "How to tune PID on a quadcopter"

Description:
By Oscar Liang

Algorithm:
Call subroutine: "Prepare"

Subroutine: "Prepare"
Listen
To the motor sound

Backup your current PID values

Switch to Rate Mode (aka Acro Mode)

Make sure your quadcopterâ€™s CG (centre of gravity) is right in the middle

Call subroutine "Set initial values"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "Set initial values"
Set RC rates, super rates and expo

Set default PID values

Lower all the values by at least half

Call subroutine "P on Roll"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "P on Roll"
Loop forever
    Cruise around

    Do some sharp turns

    If not (Does the quad dip to one side (like a wobble)?) and not (Do slow oscillations occur?)
        If Do fast oscilations occur?
            Decrease P on Roll

        Else
            break
    Else
        Increase P on Roll

Call subroutine "P on Pitch"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "P on Pitch"
Loop forever
    Do a split-S (where you move both the throttle and pitch sticks)

    Increase throttle to recover, pay attention to the pitch movement

    If Does the quad pitch up more than it should?
        Increase P on Pitch

    Else
        If not (Do fast oscilations occur?) and not (Are the motors making a twitching sound?)
            break
        Else
            Decrease P on Pitch

Call subroutine "TPA"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "TPA"
Loop forever
    Do a punch out

    If Does the quad get oscillations with high throttle?
        Increase TPA

    Else
        break
Call subroutine "D on Roll and Pitch"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "D on Roll and Pitch"
Loop forever
    Do aggressive maneuvers like flips and rolls

    If not (Does the quad overshoot at the end of the move then bounce back?) and not (Does prop wash happen? (oscillation when you descent))
        If Do fast oscillation happen at the end of a roll or flip?
            Decrease D on the affected axis

        Else
            break
    Else
        Increase D on the affected axis

Call subroutine "I on Roll"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "I on Roll"
Loop forever
    Bank your quad to the left and right

    Release stick

    If Is the quad holding the angle well?
        If not (Does the quad have stiff, robotic feeling?) and not (Does the quad have oscilations?)
            break
        Else
            Decrease I on Roll

    Else
        Increase I on Roll

Call subroutine "I on Pitch"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "I on Pitch"
Loop forever
    Fly forward, do not increase throttle

    If Does the nose keep the same angle?
        break
    Else
        Increase I on Pitch

Call subroutine "Anti Gravity Gain"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "Anti Gravity Gain"
Loop forever
    Fly in a straight line

    Do some rapid punchouts

    If Does pitch stay at the same angle?
        break
    Else
        Increase Anti Gravity

Call subroutine "P on Yaw"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "P on Yaw"
Loop forever
    Spin quickly on the yaw axis

    Stop spinning

    If Does the quad dip one side?
        Increase P on Yaw

    Else
        If Do you get fast oscilations?
            Decrease P on Yaw

        Else
            break
Call subroutine "I on Yaw"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "I on Yaw"
Loop forever
    Fly straight

    Make a turn

    If Is there drift, does the quad slide out?
        Increase I on Yaw

    Else
        break
End of subroutine
End of procedure
